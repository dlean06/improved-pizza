Task 1

  Task 1.1

    Why cant the student find their private repository when trying to save their notebook to github?

      This could be because the student skipped a step to authorize private repository access when they first connected colab to github.

    How does google colab access repositories and how can the level of access by decided?

      Google colab interacts with github through OAuth tokens and API requests. The level of access depends on the permissions granted on the OAuth page.

    How can you verify that your authentication settings are working correctly?

      If authentication is working you should be able to select from a list of both public and private respositories when saving to github.
